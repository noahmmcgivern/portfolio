# portfolio [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/noahmmcgivern/portfolio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noahmmcgivern/portfolio)

## Hey there!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my GitHub repository.

I've decided to make my portfolio website open-source so that interested beginners in Elm have an additional resource to learn from.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:
```
npm ci
```

Then, start the local development server:

```
npm start
```

## Building

Build:

```
npm test
```

Then, all static assests are located inside the out/ directory.
